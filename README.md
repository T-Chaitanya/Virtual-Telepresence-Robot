# Virtual Telepresence Robot

This project involves the development of a telepresence robot that allows users to remotely experience environments through real-time control. The robot is equipped with a gimbal-mounted camera for capturing the surroundings, and it can be controlled via Python scripts to move and rotate.

## Features

- Remote control of the robot's movement
- Gimbal rotation for panoramic view
- Python-based control scripts

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Hardware: Telepresence robot with motors and gimbal

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/T-Chaitanya/Virtual-Telepresence-Robot.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To control the robot's movement, run the following script:
  ```bash
  python car.py
  ```

- To rotate the gimbal, use:
  ```bash
  python rotate_gimbal.py
  ```

## Future Improvements

- Adding camera live feed
- Integration with a mobile app for easier control
- Autonomous navigation using AI
